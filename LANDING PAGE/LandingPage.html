        <h2>About Tranquility</h2>
        <p>
            We built Tranquility because we were tired of productivity tools that caused more stress  
            than they solved. Our app keeps you in the zone and reminds you to breathe. It keeps your thoughts clear and your mind... well Tranquil.ðŸ˜‰
        </p>
        <p> We hope you do give Tranquility a shot at least once as we built it with attention, care, & love, along with a lot of coffee.</p>
